# DSA — Data Structures & Algorithms

A personal repository of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** coursework and practice from my second year of the Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Mechanics at **Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv** (2025/2026).

> 📌 *This is not a professional or production-ready technical repo.*  
> Instead, it contains assignments, exercises, and experiments I completed while learning DSA as part of my university course.
